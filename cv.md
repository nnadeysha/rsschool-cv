### ABOUT MYSELF

I'm 30 years old. I'm a student at RS-School, I study Java Script.
I want to become a front-end developer.
My priorities in work: interesting job where I can always develop, see the result of my work.
My strengths: curiosity, perseverance, realism, sociability, optimism and purposefulness.
Unfortunately, I have no experience in IT yet, I previously worked as the head of an online store. We launched a new website for an online store and I worked a lot with the developers, mainly I gave instructions to finalize the application and add new functionality. It was then that I became interested in development.

### PROGRAMMING SKILLS

I have little programming experience at the moment. I can work with git, vscode, quite a bit with node.js, I have basic knowledge of js and layout.

### SAMPLE CODE

```
const startCorrespondOver = (event) => {
    if (event.target.classList.contains("piano-key"))
    {
    event.target.classList.add("active");
    const note = event.target.dataset.note;
    const src = `assets/audio/${note}.mp3`;
    playAudio(src);
    keys.forEach((elem) => {
        elem.addEventListener("mouseover", StartAudio)
        elem.addEventListener("mouseout", StopAudio)
    });
    }
};

```
